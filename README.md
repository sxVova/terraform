## Terraform

This repository is designed to test ansible roles. It does not pretend to be correct, but simply performs the   
functions of automatically creating machines with a static IP address and domain name. Also, a public key is   
added to the machines for access via ssh, and a private key is sent to the machine, where the ensemble will  
be located in the future, via ssh connection.
